*"Loads Faster Than Uno" - TheRealJake_12*

Welcome To Kade Engine Community.

**Feel free to use this code for your own projects. Steal it. Borrow it. I don't care.**

### How To Build From Source
<details>
This is a not to in-depth guide to build the game and get your mod going or to contribute to the engine
If you have read the normal building guide from the original engine, it most likely won't work here.
So I will now do a guide to build the game.


### Installing the needed things
1. Install the latest Haxe. Instead of using Haxe 4.1.5, as the original game used, we will update to Haxe 4.3.4 (or the latest version)
You will first need to go to this link to download [Haxe](https://haxe.org/download/) Choose your platform and just do the normal download proccess.
2. Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
3. Run `setup.bat` or `setup.sh` to install the libraries needed to compile. Alternatively, you can install from [hxpkg](https://github.com/CCobaltDev/HxPKG).
To install hxpkg and the libraries, run these commands.
```
haxelib --global install hxpkg
haxelib --global run hxpkg setup
hxpkg install
```

3.5 (Optional) If you're on Linux, you may be missing some libraries required to compile properly. Run these commands to fix some issues commonly reported.
```
sudo apt install build-essential
sudo apt install luajit
sudo apt-get install libvlc-dev
sudo apt-get install libvlccore-dev
sudo apt-get install vlc
```

5. Run `lime test windows` or `lime test windows -debug`. No debug is the release version that doenst have all the debug stuff, As the debug does.
It will take a while to build for both versions.
**Debug Builds Usually Run Slower Than Release Builds.**

7. Play Around with the code and make your mod or consider Contributing to the Engine!
